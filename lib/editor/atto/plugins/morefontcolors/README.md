# More font colours for Atto

Modification of the fontcolor plugin allowing the Moodle admin to define colors

## Installation

Install the plugin directory as usual in lib/editor/atto/plugins.

Then visit Site Administration > Plugins > Atto > More font colours to define the colours you want your users to be able to chose from. As a default, the same colours as the core atto_fontcolor colours are defined.

Finally, enable the plugin by adding 'morefontcolours' (without the quotes) in the Atto toolbar settings.
