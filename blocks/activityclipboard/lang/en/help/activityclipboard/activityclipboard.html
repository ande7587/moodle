<h1>Activity Clipboard</h1>
<!-- TODO: Update -->

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The Activity Clipboard is a block that enables sharing of Moodle content (resources, activities) between
multiple courses on your site.  You can share among teachers or among your own courses.
It copies and moves single course items without user data &mdash; similar to the &ldquo;Import&rdquo;
function in Course Administration.  Items can be collected and saved on the Activity Clipboard indefinitely,
serving as a library of frequently used course items available for duplication.
It is viewable only by teachers, course creators and administrators.
It requires Moodle version 2.0 or later and works with Topic and Weekly course formats.</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Turning On and Off</dt>
    <dd>With editing on, add the Activity Clipboard block from the block menu.
        wherever you roam courses across a site.
        Click the "X" icon to turn "off" the Activity Clipboard, although the contents of the Activity Clipboard
        will remain there when you turn it on again.</dd>
<dt>Copying to the Activity Clipboard</dt>
    <dd>You will notice a small "Copy to Activity Clipboard" icon which appears after each
        resource or activity in the center column of a Moodle course.
        Click on that icon to send a copy of that resource/activity into the Activity Clipboard.
        User data will be removed, only the activity itself will be cloned.</dd>
<dt>Copying from the Activity Clipboard</dt>
    <dd>Click "Copy to course" icon in Activity Clipboard, then the target markers appear on each section.
        You can select one of them to complete the copying, or "Cancel" which is above those.</dd>
<dt>Making folders inside the Activity Clipboard</dt>
    <dd>Click the "Move into folder" icon on a course content item and an input box will appear
        if there is no folder.  Input the name of the target folder there.
        To move an item into an existing folder, click on the "Move into folder" icon,
        then a drop-down list appears, and select the target folder.
        If you click the "Edit" icon, you will replace the drop-down list with an input box.</dd>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>Generally, the Activity Clipboard will duplicate any activity in any course that a teacher has access to.
However, Quiz questions have another set of permissions independent of site roles.
Therefore, we recommend if you wish to share questions, make the following changes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add a new role &mdash; Question Creator:
        Make this role in Site Admin &gt;&gt; Users &gt;&gt; Permissions &gt;&gt; Define roles,
        and assign all teachers to this role (in addition to other roles they already have).
        This role should be given at least the following rights (set permissions to "Allow")
        under "Course":
        <ul>
            <li>Manage Activities</li>
            <li>Manage Files</li>
            <li>Add new questions</li>
            <li>Edit all questions</li>
            <li>Edit question categories</li>
            <li>Move all questions</li>
            <li>Use all questions</li>
            <li>View all questions</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Set questions to System Question Category:  If you set questions to course or activity
        level categories, you may not be able to share them.</li>
</ol>
